# Explicit terminators help CFG backends

Capture motivation for forbidding implicit fallthrough between basic blocks.

## Design

We now require every reachable basic block to end in an explicit terminator (`ret`/`trap`/`br`/`jmp`). This makes control flow layout-independent and closer to SSA backends.

Motivation (humans):

- **Layout-independence**: fallthrough depends on bytecode placement; inserting/removing bytes can silently change CFG edges. With explicit terminators, edges are explicit and reordering blocks is semantics-preserving.
- **Relooper/structurer friendliness**: structuring algorithms want an explicit CFG. Treating “next instruction” as an implicit edge complicates building a graph and makes it sensitive to instruction boundaries.
- **Cranelift/WASM lowering**: CLIF blocks and WASM control constructs assume blocks end in terminators. When bytecode blocks already have explicit branches, lowering can map blocks directly without inserting synthetic jumps.
- **Verification/debuggability**: missing terminators become a localized verifier error instead of a runtime trap or accidental fallthrough.

This ticket is documentation-only; the implementation is in commit `890561b` on branch `verifier/fallthrough`.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Ticket records the rationale in Markdown with backticks around code identifiers.
- Ticket is closed (completed).
