# PR2: VerifiedProgram carries decoded/validated instruction stream

Make VerifiedProgram an execution artifact that includes per-function decoded instructions and precomputed metadata so the VM does not decode bytecode at runtime.

## Design

This subsumes existing ticket `et-e5a1` (cache decoded bytecode).

Shape:
- `VerifiedProgram` owns `Program` + `Vec<VerifiedFunction>` metadata.
- `VerifiedFunction` holds decoded instructions (with offsets) and any precomputed data the VM currently recomputes.
- VM interpreter dispatches over `VerifiedFunction` instructions directly.

Branch naming: `et-tagless/pr2-verified-decoded`.

## Acceptance Criteria

- VM no longer calls `decode_instructions` during run.
- `VerifiedProgram` construction performs decoding once and stores it.
- No new deps; keep `no_std + alloc`.
