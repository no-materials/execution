# Verifier/tooling: internal analysis module (CFG/dataflow)

## Design

Create a crate-internal `analysis` module to host reusable program analyses that are
useful for both verification and tooling (disasm, optimizations, debugging).

Scope (v1):
- CFG construction from bytecode (basic blocks, successors, reachability).
- Reusable bitset utility for dataflow.
- Liveness analysis (backwards) based on per-instruction reads/writes.

Constraints:
- `pub(crate)` only initially; keep APIs small while evolving.
- `no_std + alloc` friendly; avoid `std`-only features and avoid dependencies.
- No `unsafe`.

Intended consumers:
- Verifier hard checks (jump targets, block boundaries, terminators, etc).
- Verifier lints (unreachable blocks, dead stores, redundant moves).
- Future: richer verifier checks and “lint/analysis” UX without re-implementing CFG/DFG.

## Acceptance

- New `execution_tape::analysis` module exists and is `pub(crate)`.
- Verifier (and/or lint pass) uses the shared CFG/dataflow helpers (no duplicated CFG code).
- Tests remain deterministic; workspace stays green (`fmt`/`clippy -D warnings`/`test`).
